  "details": "The ancestors of half-elves were born of unions between elves and humans, bridging two worlds that often walk different paths. Some tales speak of Corellon and Sehanine blessing the first of their kind, hoping to weave harmony between elfkind and humanity. Others whisper that the first half-elves were born not from divine will but from chance encounters and the unpredictable bonds of love—or ambition. Whatever their beginnings, half-elves have carved out a place of their own, standing at the crossroads of mortal and fey bloodlines.\n\nHalf-elves resemble humans in stature and build, but their features carry the elegance and sharpness of their elven heritage. Their eyes often gleam with an otherworldly luster, and their ears, subtly pointed, mark their descent from the Fair Folk. This mingling of traits gives half-elves a beauty and presence uniquely their own, not quite human, not quite elf, yet something greater than either alone.",
