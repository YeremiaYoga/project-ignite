One story holds that these eggs were blessed by the dragon gods Bahamut and Tiamat, who wanted to populate the multiverse with people created in their image. Another story claims that dragons created the first dragonborn without the gods’ blessings. Whatever their origin, dragonborn have made homes for themselves on the Material Plane.\n\nDragonborn look like wingless, bipedal dragons—scaly, bright-eyed, and thick-boned with horns on their heads—and their coloration and other features are reminiscent of their draconic ancestors."

Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 + Constitution modifier + Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save, a creature takes 1d10 damage of the type determined by your Draconic Ancestry trait. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage. Damage increases by 1d10 at levels 5 (2d10), 11 (3d10), and 17 (4d10). You can use this Breath Weapon a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, regaining all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest."

Your wings appear to be made of the same energy as your Breath Weapon. Once used, this can’t be used again until you finish a Long Rest."
