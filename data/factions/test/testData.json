  "description": "The Adventurer’s Guild is among the oldest institutions still standing, its roots reaching back to the aftermath of the Calamity. Its true founder’s name was lost, like so much else swallowed by that age of fire and ash. Yet one remembrance endures: her title, *The Red Rose*, a hero whose thorns struck down horrors while her bloom gave hope to the broken.\n\nIt was she who first gathered wanderers and warriors beneath a single banner, forging not an army, but a fellowship. From her vision rose a guild where common folk could seek aid without fear — a place where pleas for help would always find listening ears, and where the right band of adventurers would be matched to each burden.\n\nThrough centuries of strife and peace, the Guild has remained a beacon: a hearth for the brave, a shield for the helpless, and a mirror of humanity’s will to endure. Though the founder’s name is gone, her legacy lives in every contract sealed, every quest fulfilled, and every torch lit against the dark.",
