Centuries later, that magic still thrums inside a firbolg, even one who has never lived under the boughs of a great forest.\n\nA firbolg's magic is an obscuring sort, which allowed their ancestors to pass through a forest without disturbing it. So deep is the connection between a firbolg and the wild places of the world that they can communicate with flora and fauna.\n\nFirbolgs can live up to 500 years."
